## Utilities

### find

Holy crap `find`, I always have to look at your man page. Especially on macOS.

### du

The command `du -cks * | sort -rn | head` is very helpful.

### scron

Have to try this one: [scron](https://git.2f30.org/scron/files.html)

### identify

`identify -format "%[w]x%[h]\n"`

gives you the width and height of an image.
