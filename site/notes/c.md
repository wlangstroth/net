# C

What is it with people? They have something easy, and then they just have to
make it difficult for themselves.

Python's easier, right? But then you have the environments, and the version
control, and all the packages, and whatever.

I get it for production, serious-business software. Except that now you're using
Java, right? I mean, C++? So we're back to doing C anyway. Maybe you use Erlang.

Like web programming. You can't just have yer jQuery or whatever. It has to be
some object oriented shenanigans.
