There's nothing special about "Venture Capitalists". They can trace their roots
to around the 16th century, when mercantile ships needed to raise money
(capital) to buy supplies to take them off to parts unknown and trade them at a
profit.

That's it. That's what they did in the 16th century, and that's what they do
now. They provide money and administrative help, and the captain of the ship (or
the CEO of the startup) takes the risk of life and limb, later to share the
profits.

Nowadays, it's fashionable for them to also speak publicly on the internet,
which is a travesty of poor manners. If you have so much money that your job is
to lend it to people with insane ideas, then great. Why bother anybody else
about it?

Case in point is Y Combinator's new president Sam Altman. In [a piece he wrote
for his doggedly self-serving blog](http://blog.samaltman.com/before-growth),
Altman makes one empty statement after another, creating more of a collection of
obvious bullet points than a blog post. Some examples:

> We tell startups all the time that they have to grow quickly.  That’s true,
> and very good advice ...

If you're not familiar with investor/company dynamics, that's not "good advice",
that's an order. Companies must grow, or investors will not profit. So enormous
pressure is put on entrepreneurs to expand the activities of their company, to
increase the value of an investor's share in that company.

It's actually really simple, but I guess a man's gotta mansplain.

> In the first few weeks of a startup’s life, the founders really need to figure
> out what they’re doing and why. Then they need to build a product some users
> really love.

Right here, in the second paragraph, I wondered if this was a troll. Are we
joking now? The figuring out of the whats and the whys hasn't been settled
*before* the start-up actually ... starts up?

The rest of the article spouts some truism-sounding things about providing a
product to people, which is what I thought companies did anyway. And then, to
conclude, this gem:

> As a side note, startups that don’t first figure out a product some users love
> also seem to rarely develop the sense of mission that the best companies have.

I can only imagine that nobody ever challenges this guy *ever*. Because that was
crazy obvious. You mean when the company hasn't figured out what it's doing, it
doesn't have a sense of mission? I wonder why that is?

Sadly, Mr. Altman leaves us to our own devices to discover the answer to this
mystery.
